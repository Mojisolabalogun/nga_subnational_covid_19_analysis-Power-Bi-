 Project insight
 1. Contamination: A total of 253 contamination cases were reported across 38 regions.
 2. Demographic Breakdown: Men accounted for 22 contamination cases, while women accounted for 39 cases. However, the majority of contamination cases (192) had unspecified gender.
 3. Regional Variations: Cross River had the highest contamination record with 16.8k cases, while also having the least record of recovered cases. Lagos had the highest record of unspecified gender contamination with 78k cases.
 4. Monthly Trends: January had the highest record of contamination with 54k cases. August had the highest record of death with 454 cases.
 5. Regional Death Toll: Lagos had the highest record of death by region.
 Final conclusion:
 1. The high number of unspecified gender contamination cases suggests a need for improved data collection and reporting practices.
 2. Regional variations in contamination rates and death tolls highlight the importance of targeted public health interventions and resource allocation.
 3. The peak contamination rate in January and death toll in August suggest a need for enhanced surveillance and preparedness measures during these periods.
